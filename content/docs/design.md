- update watch.js to handle .md files by adding them to the DB.posts collection
- define authors collection
- when we process a given file, treat it's category folder as a taxonomy and add to the taxonomy collection
- taxonomies routes should pull necessary data for paging through the collection
- each page added to the DB should have its route added to a DB.sitemap collection
